Please add any ideas to this document!

This document will cover design ideas and possible tech implementations.

	The overall function of the web app should be focused on delivering informational
updates to the permit applicant and providing assistance in the form of FAQ's. Secondary functionality
should be concerned with data analysis in the form of applicant feedback and life cycle tracking. 


Some important functions to consider in the design process:

	Applicant registration / Login
	Process completion meter (progress bar / check list / etc..)
	Issue resolution tools (Searchable FAQ's and/or Service Tickets)
	Feedback system (for suggestions or other input)


Tech considerations:
	Flask or Django - depending on the needs and constraints
	HTML / CSS
	MySQL
