1. Intend to combine multiple year data
    a. combine all issue data
    b. combine all final data
2. Scrub the data
    a. there are no empty fields
    b. values are not uniform - need to normalize field values
        e.g: the value of PERMITAPPROVALS field
    c. for ease of analysis, a derived attribute can be created - like permit type
        a permit with certain life cycle stages would belong to a certain type
        e.g: Permit that only needs Building approval - Type 1
             Permit taht only needs Plumbing approval - Type 2
             Permit taht only needs Mechanical approval - Type 3
             Permit taht only needs Electrical approval - Type 4
             Permit that needs Building and Plumbing approvals - Type 5
             and so on; assign values to all possible combinations
3. Analyse data
    a. Reveal different statistics
      1. Stage that incurred the least/max delay
          a. certain combinations did well/wose?
          b. analyse logically as well, to see the influencing factors and solution possible
      2. Type of permit that incurred least/max delay
          a. certain combinations did well/wose?
          b. analyse logically as well, to see the influencing factors and solution possible
      3. Predict the delay in a given stage based on historic data
          a. the end to end delay for a permit as sum of delays in all stages that the permit type has
      4. Number of permits filed/approved in a given period
          a. are the number of permits requested increasing/decreasing every year?
          b. certain type of permit requests are increasing/decreasing?
      5. Predict the approvals that can be completed in a given time
      6. Identify the KPIs to be dispalyed customer facing and should be considered for internal planning
