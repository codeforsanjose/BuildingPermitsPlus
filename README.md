# About the BuildingPermitsPlus Project

The goal of this project is to analyze historical data from building permit records to determine anything notable (such as bottle-necks etc.), and to design and develop a web interface for the application process.

As posted in the meet-up notification:

Come up with insights to help make the permitting process more readily understandable and transparent to residents and businesses. The end result might be a customer facing product that shows how long each permit takes and what the expectation should be. So, we're also interested in prototypes for a dashboard that tracks the timeline for every step in the permitting process (request, acceptance, plan reviews, inspections and approval) for a particular type of business, such as restaurant, retail, office, medical/dental clinic, and so on.
